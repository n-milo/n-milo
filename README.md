Hi! I'm Nikola Milosevic, a soon graduating electrical engineering student from Queen's University. I wrote this README to give a quick rundown of my technical skills and projects. For my full r√©sum√©, [visit here](https://github.com/n-milo/n-milo/blob/master/resume.pdf).
#### üéõÔ∏è Systems programming: C, C++, and Rust
- I like C++ and have written a [NES simulator](https://github.com/n-milo/nes) using SDL and [voxel game engine](https://github.com/n-milo/voxels) using OpenGL/GLFW
#### üìü Embedded programming: C, NIOS II Assembly, VHDL
- Wrote various [VHDL logic functions](https://github.com/n-milo/vhdl-files) for FPGAs for ELEC271: digital systems
- Wrote utilities and a [flappy bird game](https://github.com/n-milo/manji-bird) for the DE0 computer system on the Cyclone III FPGA board
#### üëÄ Computer vision: Python, Pytorch, OpenCV
- Wrote a [pet nose regressor](https://github.com/n-milo/pet-nose-regressor) using PyTorch for the final project in ELEC475: computer vision
#### üñ•Ô∏è Backend development: PHP, MySQL
- For a high school project I wrote [postt.me](https://github.com/n-milo/postt-me), a Reddit clone where users can post text, images, and videos, using PHP with no frameworks and a MySQL backing store
<!-- #### üì± Modern frontends: Typescript, React Native
- -->
#### üíº Other
- I have experience with Revit and AutoCAD, and extensive knowledge of building standards of the construction process, from my time at [Smith + Andersen](https://smithandandersen.com/)
- For fun I read, ski, play chess and the keyboard, and watch football and basketball
